# Laravel Swiss Ephemeris
This package is a wrapper to the rogergerecke/swiss-ephemeris package which is able to query the Swiss Ephemeris, in order to obtain planets positions, among the other things.

The aim of this project is to query ephemeris data to produce planetar positions in order to be used from astronomy/astrology, calendars, biodynamic agriculture, ect.

In this software, only a fraction of the swiss ephemeris are used: you can query planets, Moon, and known asteroids from **1800** CE (AD) to **2399** CE (AD).

# Installation
```bash
composer require marcoconsiglio/ephemeris
```
# Usage
First of all, to query ephemeris data you need to instantiate it. You need to pass latitude, longitude and timezone to the constructor.

```php
$ephemeris = new LaravelSwissEphemeris(
    $this->config->get("ephemeris.latitude"), 
    $this->config->get("ephemeris.longitude"),
    $this->config->get("ephemeris.timezone")
);

// or instead

$ephemeris = new LaravelSwissEphemeris(
    41.902782,    // Decimal latitude
    12.496366,    // Decimal longitude
    "Europe/Rome" // Timezone
);
```
If something went wrong (e.g. like uncorrect permission for the files placed in the folder `/lib`, outbound quering date, ect.) it will throw a `App\SwissEphemeris\SwissEphemerisException` exception.

# Moon
## SynodicRhythm
The synodic rhythm is the cycle that the Moon completes with respect to the position of the Sun. It determines the four phases of the moon and the periods of waxing and waning moons.

You can obtain a `SynodicRhythm` object, representing the Moon synodic rhythm over a period of time.
```php
/** @var \MarcoConsiglio\Ephemeris\Rhythms\SynodicRhythm $synodic_rhythm */
$synodic_rhythm = $ephemeris->getMoonSynodicRhythm(
    new Carbon, // * Starting date and time.
    7,          // The duration in days of the synodic rhythm. Default: 30
    30          // The duration in minutes of each step in the ephemeris. Default: 60
);
```

You can treat a `SynodicRhythm` as a normal [`Collection`](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/collections#available-methods). It contains [`SynodicRhythmRecord`](#synodicrhythmrecord)(s).

```php
/** @var \MarcoConsiglio\Ephemeris\Rhythms\SynodicRhythm $synodic_rhythm */
$synodic_rhythm = $ephemeris->getMoonSynodicRhythm(new Carbon("2022-01-12"), 7); 

/** @var \MarcoConsiglio\Ephemeris\Rhythms\SynodicRhythmRecord $record */
$record = $synodic_rhythm->first();

$total_record = $synodic_rhythm->count(); // 168
```
### SynodicRhythmRecord
It is a snapshot contained in the [`SynodicRhythm`](#synodicrhythm). It has some read-only properties that represents some raw values of a SynodicRhythm.
```php
/** 
 * The timestamp of the record.
 * 
 * @var \Carbon\Carbon 
 */
$record->timestamp;

/** 
 * The angular distance between the Moon and the Sun, 
 * with the Earth at the vertex. Min: -180Â°. Max: +180Â°.
 * 
 * @var \MarcoConsiglio\Trigonometry\Angle 
 */
$record->angular_distance;

/**
 * The angular distance expressed in a percentage. 
 * Min -1.0. Max: +1.0.
 * 
 *  @var float
 */
$record->percentage;
```
This is an example usage.
```php
/** @var \MarcoConsiglio\Ephemeris\Rhythms\SynodicRhythm $synodic_rhythm */
/** @var \MarcoConsiglio\Ephemeris\Rhythms\SynodicRhythmRecord $record */
foreach($synodic_rhythm as $record) { 
    echo $record->timestamp."\t".$record->angular_distance."\t".($record->percentage * 100)."%\n"; 
    // 2021-12-12 10:00:00     119Â° 24' 7.5"    66%
};
```

## MoonPeriods
A Moon period is the period when the angular distance between the Moon and the Sun (with the vertex being the Earth) is positive or negative. When it is negative it is called a **Waning Moon** period (from *Full Moon* to *New Moon*), when it is positive it is called a **Waxing Moon** period (from *New Moon* to *Full Moon*).

You can obtain a `MoonPeriods` collection from a `SynodicRhythm` object. It contains [`MoonPeriod`](#moonperiod) instances.
```php
/** @var \MarcoConsiglio\Ephemeris\Rhythms\SynodicRhythm $synodic_rhythm */
/** @var \MarcoConsiglio\Ephemeris\Rhythms\MoonPeriods $moon_periods */
$moon_periods = $synodic_rhythm->getPeriods();
```
### MoonPeriod
A MoonPeriod object cant tell you when the period start, stop and if it is waning or waxing.
```php
foreach($moon_periods as $period) {
    $type = "unknown";
    if ($period->isWaxing()) {
        $type = "waxing";
    }
    if ($period->isWaning()) {
        $type = "waning";
    }
    echo "There is a $type moon period starting from {$period->start} to {$period->end}.\n";
}
```
